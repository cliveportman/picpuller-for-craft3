# Pic Puller for Craft 3 Documentation

## Overview

**Pic Puller for Craft 3** is a plug in for Craft CMS that lets authorized users pull in their Instagram media into Craft.

Pic Puller provides native Craft tags to access Instagram media in templates. It also includes a field type that allows authorized users to browse their personal media stream on Instagram.

## What's new in version 3

**Pic Puller for Craft 3** has been rewritten for Craft CMS 3. Functionalty is the same as in version 2. 

For the sake of history, there was a significantly different version of Pic Puller in version 1 but ended due to Instagram's changed terms of API use. In late 2015, Instagram scaled back access to their API. Instagram now requires approval of all apps that attempt to use their API. Instagram would not approve any versions of Pic Puller 1 apps that users had created.

After scaling back app permissions, Pic Puller's API access was approved by Instagram. 

All instances of the Pic Puller plugin now use this new Instagram-approved API access. 

## Updating from version 2.x

Your Twig template code should be about the same. The one change you need to make is relatively minor.

The plugin handle is changing from `picpuller` to `picPuller`.

So, if you had an opeing Pic Puller tag in Craft 2 like this:

`{% for instagramdata in craft.picpuller.media_recent({'user_id' : 1,  'use_stale_cache' : true, 'limit': 4, 'max_id': nextmaxid }) %}`

It would now be like this, with an uppercase "P" in the handle name:

`{% for instagramdata in craft.picPuller.media_recent({'user_id' : 1,  'use_stale_cache' : true, 'limit': 4, 'max_id': nextmaxid }) %}`

## Limitations

The API access that Pic Puller has access to is basically limited to an authorized user's media. There is no access available to other user's public content. _Instagram does not permit searching via #hashtag for public media through Pic Puller._

There is no "hashtag" searching available, even for tags in your own media.

### Authorizing with Instagram 

To authorize a Craft site to pull in Instgram media, a user must allow access. After installing Pic Puller, the site will ask for authorization.

![Pic Puller for Craft "Account" tab in the Craft control panel](resources/img/01_Pic_Puller_for_Craft_-_Pic_Puller_for_Craft.png)

Once authorization has been granted, Pic Puller will display the authorized user's credentials.

![Pic Puller for Craft "Account" tab in the Craft control panel](resources/img/02_Pic_Puller_for_Craft_-_Pic_Puller_for_Craft.png)

Users will see _Pic Puller_ as an authorized application in their Instagram account.

### Multiple users and Pic Puller for Craft

You are not limited to one user with Pic Puller. If you have purchased the "Craft Client" or "Craft Pro" package, i.e. the paid version of Craft, additional users can also authorize their Instagram accounts. Pic Puller works without a the paid Craft CMS version but is limited to the one user allowed by that version of the Craft software.

A multiuser site can have each user display their own personal media on the site. When using the Pic Puller Image Browser the user stream search will be from each authorized user's Instagram stream.

Any "Admin" level user can view the list of authorized Pic Puller users along with their Instagram oAuth key for the Pic Puller for Craft application. Basically, you need to trust other Admins in your Craft site.

Users that have not been granted "Admin" rights within Craft can still access the Pic Puller plugin page as long as you have granted them access under the "Users" tab. Access can be granted on a one-by-one basis under the "Users" tab, or on a broader scale if you set up User Groups and provide the group access to Pic Puller. 

These non-admin users will have the ability to authorize and de-authorize Pic Puller with an Instagram account. Non-admin users will not be able to see the list of authorized users across the entire Craft site.

### Optional behavior for multiple users

![Sharing a single Instagram authorization](resources/img/04_Pic_Puller_for_Craft_-_Plugins_-_Pic_Puller_for_Craft.png)
As described above, the default behavior of Pic Puller for Craft is for each Craft user to authenticate their Craft account with their Instagram account. 

You can override this default behavior and have a single oAuth authorization be shared amongst all users of the Craft site. The most likely scenario for this feature is of a company site that has many site editors, but only a single Instagram account across the organization. Choosing to use a single Instagram authorization requires that the site developer choose a single user as the master Instagram account holder on the site. **This user must be an Admin.** The selection of the master Instagram user is made from the Pic Puller settings panel. 

Only the selected account holder will see the "Pic Puller for Craft" menu item in the global navigation. This is the menu that allows a user to create and manage the Instagram application and authorization. 

Tip: If your Instagram account holder in your organization is not someone who would typically have an admin level account to the site, one suggestion is to create an admin level account to be used solely for authorization purposes. You can have the Instagram account holder log into this account *once* to have them authorize Pic Puller to access the corporate Instagram account. Under everyday circumstances you could have them use their regular "editor" account to contribute to the site.

### Pic Puller Image Browser Field type

The Pic Puller Image Browser field type lets an authorized user browse their Instagram media stream and select media for use in a Craft entry.

When setting up a field select "Pic Puller: Instagram Browser" from the Field Type dropdown.

![Creating a Pic Puller Image Browser field type](resources/img/05_Instagram_Browser_-_Pic_Puller_for_Craft.png)

![The Pic Puller Instagram Browser](resources/img/06_Sample_entry_-_Pic_Puller_for_Craft.jpg)

![The Pic Puller Instagram Browser Thumbnail Preview](resources/img/07_Sample_entry_-_Pic_Puller_for_Craft.png)

The field type searches Instagram to retrieve a media ID for an image or video uploaded through Instagram. A small video icon in the upper lefthand corner designates that the piece of media is a video rather than an image.

The media ID is stored in the Craft database. The media file is not stored within your site as dictated by the Instagram API agreement.

The media ID is used in conjunction with the media by ID function in your templates to show media on your site. (See the **Media by ID** section of the documentation below.)

## Working with Pic Puller for Craft in your templates

### Caching of Pic Puller requests & Instagram rate limits

Although Pic Puller does not store Instagram media, it does cache the JSON data that is returned from successful Instagram API requests. 

Instagram limits the number of requests that can be made to it's API endpoints. See [https://www.instagram.com/developer/limits/](https://www.instagram.com/developer/limits/) for the full details. These limits reset every hour, but exhausting the allotted requests could result in your site not having the Instagram media you expect.

If you use the `use_stale_cache` parameter set to `true` in your Pic Puller tags, the cached JSON data will be used when Instagram does not deliver valid data back from a request. 

Pic Pullers's JSON caching does not replace Craft's own [caching tags](https://craftcms.com/docs/templating/cache "Craft CMS {% cache %} docs"). You should also use Craft's own caching in your templates.

### FAQs

#### Unexpected number of images returned

The number of images returned from a Pic Puller loop can be up to 32 images in most cases, but it's not guaranteed. Why is that? It has to do with how the Instagram API returns data. Although I've not read it in official documentation, it appears whatever number of images you request are returned from the API and then that set of images is filtered for images that may have been deleted by users. For example, if I were pulling 3 images from my Instagram feed, I would expect 3 images returned in my Pic Puller loop in Craft. If I went into my Instagram app on my phone and deleted the most recent photo I've taken, I would then only receive 2 images back in my Craft site. 

#### When will tag searching return to Pic Puller?

I'm doubtful that Instagram will re-add the hashtag search to this version of the API.
